This is a live documentation generation stack, used for some Zenika training material. It is based on Asciidoc and/or Markdown. It is a mono-repository including both framework and documents.

0% knownledge in HTML/CSS/JS is required to produce/update a document, and still being able to include advanced capabilities. Guides are provided, see hosted content above.

==== Generation features

* Support for Linux, MacOS and Windows
* There is a single link:./generate.sh[generate.sh script] to generate everything
* Generation uses Docker and is based on link:https://hub.docker.com/r/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor/dockerfile[docker-asciidoctor image]. A link:https://hub.docker.com/r/bcouetil/docker-asciidoctor[slightly modified version], to have an edge version of link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js[asciidoctor-reveal]
* The script provides a way to live-reload generated content on modifications
* Using GitLab pipelines, result is generated and hosted on GitLab pages per branch using the GitLab cache mechanism

==== Organisation features

* Documents and framework are united in a mono-repo
* Documents are in folders under a category for better segregation of subjects

== How

=== How do I generate documents ?

You can use `generate.sh` on Linux & MacOS (M1 supported). It also works on Windows link:README.adoc[using specific instructions for Git bash].

[source,shell]
----
./generate.sh [all|<category/subject>] [all|html|reveal|pdf|zip] [live]
----

* Optional parameter 1 is the documents scope of the generation
** `all` to generate all documents
** `<category/subject>` is a 2 folders deep path to documents (all documents must match this layout)
* Optional parameter 2 is the type of document
** `reveal`, `html`, `pdf`, `zip` or `all`
* Optional parameter 3 is `live` for link:[live-reload] in your favorite web browser

.Examples
[source,shell]
----
# generate html version of devops/kubernetes-user documents
./generate.sh devops/kubernetes-user html

# generate everything for every documents
./generate.sh
# equivalent to
./generate.sh all all
----

Slides, HTML and PDF are generated in `build-docs` folder. Target folder is cleaned each time to ensure update of generated content.

NOTE: This script is also used by CI

==== Live reload

===== Debian/Ubuntu

`generate.sh` provides a live reload solution based on `inotifywait` on Unix environment:

* Install `inotify-tools`

[source,shell]
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools

* Generate at least once for the server to have files to serve

[source,shell]
----
./generate.sh devops/kubernetes-user reveal
----

* Start a http server

[source,shell]
cd build-docs
python3 -m http.server

* In another terminal, launch live reload mode

[source,shell]
----
./generate.sh devops/kubernetes-user reveal live
----

You can now browse files from local server, for example http://localhost:8000/kubernetes-user.htm. Files are automatically refreshed in your browser, thanks to a JS script included in generated HTML.

NOTE: No Asciidoc built-in live reload for now, link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/[documentation present some alternatives] but not for Reveal.js.  Some other solutions involve VS Code extensions or Ruby in an link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/issues/248[open issue].

===== MS Windows

You can simulate a basic continuous regeneration every 5 seconds with this code running under any windows console (Windows or Windows+R and then type ‚Äúcmd‚Äù and validate)

[source,shell]
----
for /l %g in () do @(<ANY COMMAND> & timeout /t 5)

# In our case : 
for /l %g in () do @(generate agile\kanban-1j reveal & timeout /t 5)
----

===== MacOS

Not yet supported, MR are welcome ü§ì

=== How do I migrate from existing Markdown documents ?

This stack is more for new documents for people preferring Asciidoc. But an actual Markdown document can be migrated pretty fast.

TIP: For small text blocks there are online translation tools such as https://markdown2asciidoc.com/

==== Pre-requisite

Careful with `|` often not handled correctly if not in tables. Modify them first.

Ex: `Pull|Merge` changed to `Pull/Merge`

==== .md to .adoc automatically

Use preferably Kramdoc.

Although `pandoc` can link:https://matthewsetter.com/convert-markdown-to-asciidoc-withpandoc/[also be used], `kramdoc` gives link:https://matthewsetter.com/convert-markdown-to-asciidoc-with-kramdown-asciidoc/[better results].

.Install Ruby and Kramdoc
[source, shell]
sudo apt-get install ruby-full rename
sudo gem install kramdown-asciidoc

.Launch on a file
[source, shell]
kramdoc --output=getting-started.adoc --imagesdir=ressources --lazy-ids --heading-offset=1 --wrap=ventilate getting-started.md

.Launch on a folder
[source, shell]
find ./ -name "*.md" -type f -exec sh -c 'kramdoc --imagesdir=ressources --lazy-ids --heading-offset=1 --wrap=ventilate --output=_includes/{}.adoc {}' \;

.Rename files
[source, shell]
find _includes -type f -name "*.adoc" -exec rename s/".md"/""/g {} \;

==== Post-processing for Zenika trainings migration

* Delete agenda if any (use Table of Content, see examples)

* Replace in every .adoc files (VS Code regex style)

== Why

=== Why Asciidoc over Markdown ?

TLDR; standard Markdown is too poor as a lightweight markup language, and needs too many addons and custom development to fit HTML, Reveal.js and PDF.

Some elaborated articles :

* link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/asciidoc-vs-markdown/[Compare AsciiDoc to Markdown]
* link:https://docs-as-co.de/news/why-asciidoc/[Why you should use AsciiDoc to document your Software Solution]
* link:https://opensource.com/article/22/8/drop-markdown-asciidoc[Try AsciiDoc instead of Markdown]
* link:https://blog.miguelcoba.com/asciidoc-is-the-better-markdown[AsciiDoc is the better Markdown]
* link:https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/compare-markup-language-asciidoc-markdown/[Lightweight Markup Languages: This Is Why You Should Use AsciiDoc Over Regular Markdown]

The current stack has been gathered and maintained by a single person in his spare time. Almost no development needed. this is hardly possible on markdown stacks with the same features coverage.

=== Why a Mono-repo ?

* Simplicity : To ease core modifications and generation in a single MR
* Modularity : To allow include in documents from one to another

=== Why do Reveal.js themes all look pretty much the same ?

There is no particular reason.

You don't like the result ? It's perfectly fine. You can change basic things like slide transition and background in-presentation. But, most important, you can contribute with any Reveal.js CSS you find/produce that fits your presentation style, just add it in the appropriate folder and import it at the beginning of your presentation.

Here is a list of nice Asciidoc-based Reveal.js slide decks, for inspiration :
