= How to Run generate.sh Under Windows Using Git Bash  

This guide will help you launch a shell script (`generate.sh`) in Windows using Git Bash. Follow the steps carefully, even if you're new to Windows or Git Bash.  

== Step 1: Install Git for Windows  

. Download *Git for Windows* from https://gitforwindows.org[https://gitforwindows.org].  
. Run the installer and follow the instructions.  
. Make sure Git Bash is installed as part of the setup.  

== Step 2: Verify Docker Works in Git Bash  

. Open *Git Bash*.  
. Run the following command:  

```
   docker ps -a
```  

*** If you see a list of containers, *Docker is working*.  
   - If you see an error, make sure Docker Desktop is running and configured correctly.  

== Step 3: Install `cwRsync`  

. Download *cwRsync* from https://www.itefix.net/cwrsync/client[this link].  
. Unzip it into a folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\cwrsync`).  
. Add the `bin` folder to your Windows system-wide *Path* environment variable:  
*** Press *Win + R*, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press *Enter*.  
   - Go to the *Advanced* tab and click *Environment Variables*.  
   - Under *System variables*, find and select `Path`, then click *Edit*.  
   - Click *New* and add:  

```
     C:\Program Files\cwrsync\bin
```
*** Click *OK* on all windows to save the changes.  

. *Verify that `rsync.exe` works in PowerShell:*  
*** Open *PowerShell* (press *Win + R*, type `powershell`, and hit *Enter*).  
   - Run the following command:  

```
     rsync --version
```
*** If you see output displaying the rsync version, *it is correctly installed*.  
   - If you get an error like `Command not found`, restart your computer and try again.  
   - If it still doesnâ€™t work, double-check that the `cwrsync\bin` folder is correctly added to the system *Path*.  

== Step 4: Modify `generate.sh`  

Open `generate.sh` in a text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or VS Code) and replace *every occurrence* of `$PWD` with:  

```
$(pwd -W)
```

This fixes path issues in Git Bash on Windows.  

== Step 5: Run the Script in Git Bash  

. Open *Git Bash*.  
. Navigate to the script's directory using `cd`. Example:  

```
   cd /c/path/to/your/project
```

. Set an environment variable to prevent Git Bash from interfering with file paths:  

```
   export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
```

. Run the script:  

```
   ./generate.sh guides/guides reveal
```

If everything is set up correctly, the script should now execute without issues! ðŸŽ‰
